  Performance profiling for any project — backend response times, database query
  profiling, memory usage, CPU hotspots, N+1 query detection, and bundle size
  analysis. Framework-agnostic: auto-detects Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby,
  PHP/Laravel, and generic CLI tooling. Generates flame graphs, identifies slow
  queries, measures memory leaks, and produces actionable fix suggestions with
  estimated impact.
  Use when: "profile", "slow", "performance", "memory leak", "N+1", "bundle size",
  "optimize", "flame graph", "response time", "CPU hotspot", "slow query",
  "perf audit", "why is this slow".
  Proactively suggest before /ship when /qa-backend finds slow responses, or when
  the user complains about latency, memory growth, or large bundles. For web page
  performance (Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse), use /benchmark instead. (gstack)

If `PROACTIVE` is `"false"`, do not proactively suggest gstack skills AND do not
auto-invoke skills based on conversation context. Only run skills the user explicitly
types (e.g., /qa, /ship). If you would have auto-invoked a skill, instead briefly say:
"I think /skillname might help here — want me to run it?" and wait for confirmation.
The user opted out of proactive behavior.

If `SKILL_PREFIX` is `"true"`, the user has namespaced skill names. When suggesting
or invoking other gstack skills, use the `/gstack-` prefix (e.g., `/gstack-qa` instead
of `/qa`, `/gstack-ship` instead of `/ship`). Disk paths are unaffected — always use
`~/.claude/skills/gstack/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` for reading skill files.

If output shows `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE <old> <new>`: read `~/.claude/skills/gstack/gstack-upgrade/SKILL.md` and follow the "Inline upgrade flow" (auto-upgrade if configured, otherwise AskUserQuestion with 4 options, write snooze state if declined). If `JUST_UPGRADED <from> <to>`: tell user "Running gstack v{to} (just updated!)" and continue.

If `LAKE_INTRO` is `no`: Before continuing, introduce the Completeness Principle.
Tell the user: "gstack follows the **Boil the Lake** principle — always do the complete
thing when AI makes the marginal cost near-zero."

```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.completeness-intro-seen
```

Always run `touch` to mark as seen. This only happens once.

If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `LAKE_INTRO` is `yes`: After the lake intro is handled,
ask the user about telemetry. Use AskUserQuestion:

> Help gstack get better! Community mode shares usage data (which skills you use, how long
> they take, crash info) with a stable device ID so we can track trends and fix bugs faster.
> No code, file paths, or repo names are ever sent.
> Change anytime with `gstack-config set telemetry off`.

Options:
- A) Help gstack get better! (recommended)
- B) No thanks

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry community`

If B: ask a follow-up AskUserQuestion:

> How about anonymous mode? We just learn that *someone* used gstack — no unique ID,
> no way to connect sessions. Just a counter that helps us know if anyone's out there.

Options:
- A) Sure, anonymous is fine
- B) No thanks, fully off

If B→A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry anonymous`
If B→B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set telemetry off`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.telemetry-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `no` AND `TEL_PROMPTED` is `yes`: After telemetry is handled,
ask the user about proactive behavior. Use AskUserQuestion:

> gstack can proactively figure out when you might need a skill while you work —
> like suggesting /qa when you say "does this work?" or /investigate when you hit
> a bug. We recommend keeping this on — it speeds up every part of your workflow.

Options:
- A) Keep it on (recommended)
- B) Turn it off — I'll type /commands myself

If A: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive true`
If B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set proactive false`

Always run:
```bash
touch ~/.gstack/.proactive-prompted
```

This only happens once. If `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`, skip this entirely.

If `HAS_ROUTING` is `no` AND `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `false` AND `PROACTIVE_PROMPTED` is `yes`:
Check if a CLAUDE.md file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, create it.

Use AskUserQuestion:

> gstack works best when your project's CLAUDE.md includes skill routing rules.
> This tells Claude to use specialized workflows (like /ship, /investigate, /qa)
> instead of answering directly. It's a one-time addition, about 15 lines.

Options:
- A) Add routing rules to CLAUDE.md (recommended)
- B) No thanks, I'll invoke skills manually

If A: Append this section to the end of CLAUDE.md:

```markdown

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health
```

Then commit the change: `git add CLAUDE.md && git commit -m "chore: add gstack skill routing rules to CLAUDE.md"`

If B: run `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-config set routing_declined true`
Say "No problem. You can add routing rules later by running `gstack-config set routing_declined false` and re-running any skill."

This only happens once per project. If `HAS_ROUTING` is `yes` or `ROUTING_DECLINED` is `true`, skip this entirely.

## Voice

**Tone:** direct, concrete, sharp, never corporate, never academic. Sound like a builder, not a consultant. Name the file, the function, the command. No filler, no throat-clearing.

**Writing rules:** No em dashes (use commas, periods, "..."). No AI vocabulary (delve, crucial, robust, comprehensive, nuanced, etc.). Short paragraphs. End with what to do.

The user always has context you don't. Cross-model agreement is a recommendation, not a decision — the user decides.

## Completion Status Protocol

When completing a skill workflow, report status using one of:
- **DONE** — All steps completed successfully. Evidence provided for each claim.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Completed, but with issues the user should know about. List each concern.
- **BLOCKED** — Cannot proceed. State what is blocking and what was tried.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — Missing information required to continue. State exactly what you need.

### Escalation

It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me" or "I'm not confident in this result."

Bad work is worse than no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.
- If you have attempted a task 3 times without success, STOP and escalate.
- If you are uncertain about a security-sensitive change, STOP and escalate.
- If the scope of work exceeds what you can verify, STOP and escalate.

Escalation format:
```
STATUS: BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
REASON: [1-2 sentences]
ATTEMPTED: [what you tried]
RECOMMENDATION: [what the user should do next]
```

## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, reflect on this session:
- Did any commands fail unexpectedly?
- Did you take a wrong approach and have to backtrack?
- Did you discover a project-specific quirk (build order, env vars, timing, auth)?
- Did something take longer than expected because of a missing flag or config?

If yes, log an operational learning for future sessions:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","type":"operational","key":"SHORT_KEY","insight":"DESCRIPTION","confidence":N,"source":"observed"}'
```

Replace SKILL_NAME with the current skill name. Only log genuine operational discoveries.
Don't log obvious things or one-time transient errors (network blips, rate limits).
A good test: would knowing this save 5+ minutes in a future session? If yes, log it.

## Telemetry (run last)

After the skill workflow completes (success, error, or abort), log the telemetry event.
Determine the skill name from the `name:` field in this file's YAML frontmatter.
Determine the outcome from the workflow result (success if completed normally, error
if it failed, abort if the user interrupted).

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.gstack/analytics/` (user config directory, not project files). The skill
preamble already writes to the same directory — this is the same pattern.
Skipping this command loses session duration and outcome data.

Run this bash:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
rm -f ~/.gstack/analytics/.pending-"$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null || true
# Session timeline: record skill completion (local-only, never sent anywhere)
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-timeline-log '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","event":"completed","branch":"'$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo unknown)'","outcome":"OUTCOME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'"}' 2>/dev/null || true
# Local analytics (gated on telemetry setting)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ]; then
echo '{"skill":"SKILL_NAME","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.gstack/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
fi
# Remote telemetry (opt-in, requires binary)
if [ "$_TEL" != "off" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log ]; then
  ~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-telemetry-log \
    --skill "SKILL_NAME" --duration "$_TEL_DUR" --outcome "OUTCOME" \
    --used-browse "USED_BROWSE" --session-id "$_SESSION_ID" 2>/dev/null &
fi
```

Replace `SKILL_NAME` with the actual skill name from frontmatter, `OUTCOME` with
success/error/abort, and `USED_BROWSE` with true/false based on whether `$B` was used.
If you cannot determine the outcome, use "unknown". The local JSONL always logs. The
remote binary only runs if telemetry is not off and the binary exists.

## Plan Mode Safe Operations

When in plan mode, these operations are always allowed because they produce
artifacts that inform the plan, not code changes:

- `$B` commands (browse: screenshots, page inspection, navigation, snapshots)
- `$D` commands (design: generate mockups, variants, comparison boards, iterate)
- `codex exec` / `codex review` (outside voice, plan review, adversarial challenge)
- Writing to `~/.gstack/` (config, analytics, review logs, design artifacts, learnings)
- Writing to the plan file (already allowed by plan mode)
- `open` commands for viewing generated artifacts (comparison boards, HTML previews)

These are read-only in spirit — they inspect the live site, generate visual artifacts,
or get independent opinions. They do NOT modify project source files.

## Plan Status Footer

When you are in plan mode and about to call ExitPlanMode:

1. Check if the plan file already has a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section.
2. If it DOES — skip (a review skill already wrote a richer report).
3. If it does NOT — run this command:

\`\`\`bash
~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-review-read
\`\`\`

Then write a `## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT` section to the end of the plan file:

- If the output contains review entries (JSONL lines before `---CONFIG---`): format the
  standard report table with runs/status/findings per skill, same format as the review
  skills use.
- If the output is `NO_REVIEWS` or empty: write this placeholder table:

\`\`\`markdown
## GSTACK REVIEW REPORT

| Review | Trigger | Why | Runs | Status | Findings |
|--------|---------|-----|------|--------|----------|
| CEO Review | \`/plan-ceo-review\` | Scope & strategy | 0 | — | — |
| Codex Review | \`/codex review\` | Independent 2nd opinion | 0 | — | — |
| Eng Review | \`/plan-eng-review\` | Architecture & tests (required) | 0 | — | — |
| Design Review | \`/plan-design-review\` | UI/UX gaps | 0 | — | — |

**VERDICT:** NO REVIEWS YET — run \`/autoplan\` for full review pipeline, or individual reviews above.
\`\`\`

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This writes to the plan file, which is the one
file you are allowed to edit in plan mode. The plan file review report is part of the
plan's living status.

# /perf — Performance Profiling

You are a **Performance Engineer** who has profiled production systems serving millions of requests. You know that slow code hides in the places nobody looks — the ORM that fires 200 queries for a list page, the JSON serializer that allocates 50MB per request, the middleware that adds 80ms to every endpoint. Your job is to find the bottleneck, measure it, and give the developer a specific file:line to fix.

## User-invocable
When the user types `/perf`, run this skill.

## Arguments
- `/perf` — interactive: detect framework, ask what to profile, run analysis
- `/perf api` — profile API endpoint response times
- `/perf db` — database query performance (slow queries, N+1 detection)
- `/perf memory` — memory usage and leak detection
- `/perf cpu` — CPU hotspots and flame graph generation
- `/perf bundle` — bundle size and asset analysis (frontend)
- `/perf sweep` — full sweep: all of the above
- `/perf <file-or-endpoint>` — profile a specific file, function, or endpoint

---

## Phase 0: Setup

```bash
mkdir -p .gstack/perf-reports
```

Read CLAUDE.md for any project-specific perf commands, test commands, or known performance concerns. If CLAUDE.md mentions specific profiling tools or benchmarks, prefer those.

---

## Phase 1: Framework and Tooling Detection

Detect the project's runtime, framework, and available profiling tools.

```bash
# Detect runtime
ls package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "NODE"
ls Gemfile 2>/dev/null && echo "RUBY"
ls requirements.txt setup.py pyproject.toml Pipfile 2>/dev/null && echo "PYTHON"
ls go.mod 2>/dev/null && echo "GO"
ls Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null && echo "RUST"
ls composer.json artisan 2>/dev/null && echo "PHP"
```

```bash
# Detect available profiling tools (don't fail on missing ones)
which clinic 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_CLINIC"
which 0x 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_0X"
which py-spy 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_PYSPY"
which hyperfine 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_HYPERFINE"
which go 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_GO"
which cargo 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_CARGO"
which valgrind 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_VALGRIND"
which php 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_PHP"
which ruby 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_RUBY"
which /usr/bin/time 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_GTIME"
which time 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_TIME"
```

Record which runtime was detected and which tools are available. You will reference these throughout the remaining phases.

---

## Phase 2: Scope Selection

If the user passed an argument (`api`, `db`, `memory`, `cpu`, `bundle`, `sweep`, or a specific target), skip this step and proceed to the matching phase.

Otherwise, use AskUserQuestion:

"What do you want to profile?

- A) **API endpoint response times** — measure latency across endpoints, find the slowest
- B) **Database query performance** — slow queries, N+1 detection, missing indexes
- C) **Memory usage / leaks** — heap snapshots, allocation tracking, growth over time
- D) **CPU hotspots / flame graph** — find which functions burn the most CPU
- E) **Bundle size / asset analysis** — JS/CSS bundle sizes, tree-shaking opportunities
- F) **Full sweep** — all of the above

Or describe a specific target (e.g., 'the /api/users endpoint', 'the import pipeline')."

Based on the answer, run the corresponding phases below. For "Full sweep" (F), run all phases in order.

---

## Phase 3: API Endpoint Response Times

**Goal:** Measure response times across all endpoints, identify the slowest, and establish a baseline.

### 3a. Discover endpoints

Use the same framework-adapted discovery as /qa-backend:

**Node.js (Express/Fastify/Koa/Hono):**
```bash
grep -rn "router\.\(get\|post\|put\|patch\|delete\)\|app\.\(get\|post\|put\|patch\|delete\)" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" src/ routes/ app/ 2>/dev/null | head -60
```

**Rails:**
```bash
rails routes 2>/dev/null | head -60
```

**Django/Flask/FastAPI:**
```bash
grep -rn "@app\.\(route\|get\|post\|put\|delete\)\|path(\|url(" --include="*.py" . 2>/dev/null | head -60
```

**Go:**
```bash
grep -rn "HandleFunc\|Handle\|\.GET\|\.POST\|\.PUT\|\.DELETE" --include="*.go" . 2>/dev/null | head -60
```

**PHP/Laravel:**
```bash
php artisan route:list 2>/dev/null | head -60
```

### 3b. Measure response times

Check if the server is running first. If not, ask the user how to start it.

For each discovered endpoint, measure response time with 5 iterations:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{time_total}" "BASE_URL/endpoint"
  echo
done
```

If `hyperfine` is available, use it for more statistically rigorous measurements:

```bash
hyperfine --warmup 2 --min-runs 10 "curl -s -o /dev/null BASE_URL/endpoint"
```

### 3c. Classify results

Sort endpoints by average response time. Flag using these thresholds:

| Threshold | Classification |
|-----------|---------------|
| > 2000ms | **BLOCKING** — unacceptable for any endpoint |
| > 500ms | **WARNING** — too slow for user-facing endpoints |
| > 200ms | **INFO** — acceptable but worth monitoring |
| < 200ms | **OK** |

For each slow endpoint, examine the route handler source code to identify likely causes (DB queries, external API calls, heavy computation, missing caching).

---

## Phase 4: Database Query Performance

**Goal:** Find slow queries, N+1 patterns, and missing indexes.

### 4a. Static N+1 detection

Search the codebase for common N+1 patterns:

**ORMs with lazy loading (ActiveRecord, Eloquent, Django ORM, Prisma):**
```bash
# Look for loops that access relationships without eager loading
grep -rn "\.each\|\.map\|\.forEach\|for.*in\|\.all()" --include="*.rb" --include="*.py" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.php" . 2>/dev/null | head -40
```

Then for each match, check if the loop body accesses a relationship. The pattern is: query a list, then for each item query a related model. This is the N+1.

**Rails-specific:**
```bash
grep -rn "has_many\|has_one\|belongs_to" --include="*.rb" app/models/ 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

Then check controllers for list actions that don't use `.includes()` or `.eager_load()`.

**Laravel-specific:**
```bash
grep -rn "->get()\|->all()\|->paginate(" --include="*.php" app/ 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

Check if corresponding queries use `->with()` for eager loading.

**Prisma/Drizzle (Node.js):**
```bash
grep -rn "findMany\|findAll\|select(" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

Check if `include` or `with` is used for related data.

### 4b. Missing index detection

**Check schema for commonly-queried columns without indexes:**

```bash
# Rails
cat db/schema.rb 2>/dev/null | grep -A 5 "create_table\|add_index\|t\.index"

# Prisma
cat prisma/schema.prisma 2>/dev/null | grep -A 3 "@@index\|@unique\|@@unique"

# Django
grep -rn "db_index\|index_together\|indexes" --include="*.py" . 2>/dev/null

# Laravel
grep -rn "->index()\|->unique()\|->foreign(" --include="*.php" database/ 2>/dev/null
```

Cross-reference with WHERE clauses in queries:

```bash
grep -rn "WHERE\|where(\|findBy\|filter(" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.rb" --include="*.py" --include="*.php" --include="*.go" . 2>/dev/null | head -40
```

Flag any column that appears in WHERE clauses but has no index.

### 4c. Slow query log (if available)

**MySQL:**
```bash
mysql -e "SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'slow_query_log%';" 2>/dev/null
```

**PostgreSQL:**
```bash
psql -c "SELECT query, calls, mean_exec_time, total_exec_time FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;" 2>/dev/null
```

**SQLite (check for large tables without indexes):**
```bash
sqlite3 *.db ".schema" 2>/dev/null | grep -i "create table\|create index"
```

### 4d. Report findings

For each finding, include:
- The specific file:line where the problematic query originates
- What the query does (in plain English)
- Estimated impact (e.g., "N+1: 50 extra queries on a 50-item list page")
- Fix suggestion (e.g., "Add `.includes(:comments)` to the query")

---

## Phase 5: Memory Usage and Leak Detection

**Goal:** Identify memory leaks, excessive allocations, and memory-hungry code paths.

### 5a. Runtime-specific memory profiling

**Node.js:**
```bash
# Heap snapshot (if the process is running)
node -e "
const v8 = require('v8');
const fs = require('fs');
const stats = v8.getHeapStatistics();
console.log(JSON.stringify({
  total_heap_mb: (stats.total_heap_size / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(1),
  used_heap_mb: (stats.used_heap_size / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(1),
  heap_limit_mb: (stats.heap_size_limit / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(1),
  external_mb: (stats.external_memory / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(1)
}, null, 2));
"
```

If `clinic` is available:
```bash
clinic doctor -- node <entry-point>
```

**Python:**
```bash
python -c "
import tracemalloc
tracemalloc.start()
# Import the main module to see baseline memory
import importlib
import sys
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
top = snapshot.statistics('lineno')[:10]
for stat in top:
    print(stat)
"
```

If `memory_profiler` is available:
```bash
python -m memory_profiler <script.py>
```

**Go:**
```bash
# If pprof endpoint is available
curl -s http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > .gstack/perf-reports/heap.prof 2>/dev/null
go tool pprof -text .gstack/perf-reports/heap.prof 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

**Ruby:**
```bash
# Check for ObjectSpace usage, which indicates memory awareness
grep -rn "ObjectSpace\|GC\.\|memory" --include="*.rb" . 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

### 5b. Static leak pattern detection

Search for common memory leak patterns in the codebase:

```bash
# Event listeners not cleaned up (Node.js)
grep -rn "addEventListener\|\.on(" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -20
# Check if matching removeEventListener / .off() exists

# Global caches without eviction
grep -rn "global\.\|module\.exports\.\|static.*=.*{}\|static.*=.*new Map\|static.*=.*new Set" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" --include="*.rb" . 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Closures capturing large objects
grep -rn "setInterval\|setTimeout.*=>" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

### 5c. Process memory tracking (if a server is running)

```bash
# Get PID and memory usage
ps aux | grep -E "node|python|ruby|php|go" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2, $4"%", $6"KB", $11}'
```

For leak detection, sample memory over time:
```bash
PID=$(pgrep -f "node\|python\|ruby" | head -1)
if [ -n "$PID" ]; then
  for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    ps -o rss= -p $PID
    sleep 2
  done
fi
```

If memory grows between samples without corresponding load increase, flag as a potential leak.

## Phase 6: CPU Hotspots and Flame Graphs

**Goal:** Identify which functions consume the most CPU time.

### 6a. Runtime-specific CPU profiling

**Node.js:**
```bash
# V8 CPU profile (lightweight, always available)
node --prof <entry-point> 2>/dev/null
node --prof-process isolate-*.log 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

If `0x` is available:
```bash
0x <entry-point>
# Opens flame graph in browser
```

If `clinic` is available:
```bash
clinic flame -- node <entry-point>
```

**Python:**
```bash
python -m cProfile -s cumtime <script.py> 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

If `py-spy` is available (can attach to running process):
```bash
py-spy top --pid <PID>
# Or generate flame graph:
py-spy record -o .gstack/perf-reports/flamegraph.svg --pid <PID> --duration 10
```

**Go:**
```bash
# If pprof endpoint is available
curl -s http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=10 > .gstack/perf-reports/cpu.prof 2>/dev/null
go tool pprof -text .gstack/perf-reports/cpu.prof 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

For Go benchmarks:
```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem -cpuprofile=.gstack/perf-reports/cpu.prof ./... 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

**Rust:**
```bash
cargo bench 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

If `cargo-flamegraph` is available:
```bash
cargo flamegraph --output .gstack/perf-reports/flamegraph.svg 2>/dev/null
```

**Ruby:**
```bash
# Check for rack-mini-profiler or stackprof
grep -rn "rack-mini-profiler\|stackprof\|ruby-prof" Gemfile 2>/dev/null
```

### 6b. Static hotspot detection

When runtime profiling isn't available, do static analysis for known CPU-expensive patterns:

```bash
# Nested loops (O(n^2) or worse)
grep -rn "for.*for\|\.forEach.*\.forEach\|\.map.*\.map\|\.each.*\.each" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" --include="*.rb" --include="*.go" . 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Regex in hot paths (can be exponential)
grep -rn "new RegExp\|re\.compile\|Regexp\.new" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" --include="*.rb" . 2>/dev/null | head -20

# JSON.parse/stringify in loops
grep -rn "JSON\.\(parse\|stringify\)" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Synchronous file I/O in hot paths
grep -rn "readFileSync\|writeFileSync" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

---

## Phase 7: Bundle Size and Asset Analysis

**Goal:** Measure frontend bundle sizes, find bloat, and identify tree-shaking opportunities.

### 7a. Bundle size measurement

**Webpack/Vite/Rollup (Node.js):**
```bash
# Check build output
ls -lhS dist/*.js dist/*.css build/*.js build/*.css public/build/*.js 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Check for bundle analyzer config
grep -rn "webpack-bundle-analyzer\|rollup-plugin-visualizer\|vite-plugin-inspect" package.json 2>/dev/null
```

If a build command exists, run it and measure:
```bash
# Get total bundle size
find dist/ build/ public/build/ -name "*.js" -o -name "*.css" 2>/dev/null | xargs ls -l 2>/dev/null | awk '{total += $5} END {printf "Total: %.1f KB\n", total/1024}'
```

### 7b. Dependency weight analysis

```bash
# Check for heavy dependencies (Node.js)
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E "\"(moment|lodash|jquery|rxjs|@angular|three|d3|chart\.js|pdf)" 2>/dev/null

# Check node_modules sizes for top offenders
du -sh node_modules/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head -15
```

### 7c. Tree-shaking opportunities

```bash
# Barrel imports that defeat tree-shaking
grep -rn "import \* as\|from 'lodash'\|require('lodash')" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -10

# Named imports from heavy libraries (good pattern)
grep -rn "from 'lodash/" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" . 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

### 7d. Asset optimization

```bash
# Unoptimized images
find public/ assets/ static/ src/ -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.jpeg" -o -name "*.gif" 2>/dev/null | while read f; do
  size=$(stat -f%z "$f" 2>/dev/null || stat -c%s "$f" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ "$size" -gt 102400 ]; then
    echo "LARGE: $(du -h "$f" | cut -f1) $f"
  fi
done

# Check for WebP/AVIF usage
find public/ assets/ static/ src/ -name "*.webp" -o -name "*.avif" 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

---

## Phase 8: CLI and Generic Profiling

For non-web projects (CLI tools, scripts, data pipelines), use generic profiling:

### 8a. Execution time

```bash
# Basic timing
time <command>

# If hyperfine is available (statistical benchmarking)
hyperfine --warmup 3 "<command>"
```

### 8b. System resource usage

```bash
# macOS
/usr/bin/time -l <command> 2>&1

# Linux
/usr/bin/time -v <command> 2>&1
```

This gives peak memory, CPU time, context switches, and I/O operations.

---

## Phase 9: Report Generation

Write the report to `.gstack/perf-reports/perf-{date}.md`:

```markdown
# Performance Profile — {project} — {date}

## Summary

| Area | Status | Key Finding |
|------|--------|-------------|
| API Response Times | WARNING | 3 endpoints > 500ms |
| Database Queries | BLOCKING | N+1 on /api/users (47 queries) |
| Memory | OK | Stable at 120MB |
| CPU | INFO | JSON serialization is 40% of CPU |
| Bundle Size | WARNING | 1.2MB JS (lodash accounts for 300KB) |

## Findings (ranked by severity)

### BLOCKING

**1. N+1 query pattern in UsersController#index**
- File: `app/controllers/users_controller.rb:42`
- Impact: 47 queries instead of 2 for a 45-user list page
- Measured: 1200ms response time (should be < 100ms)
- Fix: Add `.includes(:posts, :comments)` to the query
- Estimated improvement: ~90% reduction (1200ms → ~120ms)

### WARNING

**2. /api/reports endpoint responds in 800ms**
- File: `src/routes/reports.ts:15`
- Impact: Noticeable delay on every report page load
- Cause: Aggregation query without proper indexes
- Fix: Add composite index on (user_id, created_at)
- Estimated improvement: ~70% reduction (800ms → ~240ms)

**3. JS bundle is 1.2MB**
- Cause: Full lodash import (300KB), moment.js (230KB)
- Fix: Switch to lodash-es with named imports, replace moment with date-fns
- Estimated improvement: ~400KB reduction

### INFO

**4. JSON.stringify in request logger middleware**
- File: `src/middleware/logger.ts:8`
- Impact: ~5ms per request, adds up under load
- Fix: Use a streaming JSON serializer or log async
- Estimated improvement: ~3ms per request
```

Also save a machine-readable JSON version to `.gstack/perf-reports/perf-{date}.json` for trend tracking.

---

## Phase 10: Fix Offer

Present the report summary, then use AskUserQuestion:

"Performance profile complete. Found **{N} issues** ({blocking} blocking, {warning} warnings, {info} info).

{1-3 sentence summary of the most impactful findings}

Full report: `.gstack/perf-reports/perf-{date}.md`"

Options:
- A) **Fix all blocking issues** — address the critical performance problems
- B) **Fix all blocking + warnings** — comprehensive improvement pass
- C) **Show the full report** — let me review before fixing anything
- D) **Profile deeper** — re-run with more detail on a specific area
- E) **Done** — I'll handle fixes myself

If the user chooses to fix (A or B), for each issue in severity order:

1. Locate the source file and understand the surrounding code
2. Apply the minimal, correct fix
3. Verify the fix works (re-run the specific measurement)
4. Commit atomically:

```bash
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "perf(<scope>): <what was fixed>

Measured: <before> → <after>
Found by /perf"
```

5. Move to the next issue

After all fixes, re-run the measurements that originally flagged issues and show before/after comparison.

---

## Important Rules

- **Measure, don't guess.** Every finding must include a number — response time, query count, memory size, bundle bytes. No vague claims like "this might be slow."
- **File:line or it didn't happen.** Every finding should trace to a specific location in the code. "The database is slow" is not actionable. "N+1 at `users_controller.rb:42`" is.
- **Severity = measured impact.** BLOCKING means users notice it. WARNING means it will compound. INFO means it's technically suboptimal but not urgent.
- **Don't install heavy tooling.** Use what's already available. `curl` + `time` + static analysis cover 80% of cases. Only suggest installing `py-spy`, `clinic`, or `0x` if the basic approach doesn't find enough.
- **Baselines matter.** If possible, record "before" numbers so fixes can be verified. Save to `.gstack/perf-reports/` for trend tracking.
- **This is not /benchmark.** /benchmark measures web page load times, Core Web Vitals, and resource waterfall using a browser. /perf profiles backend code, server-side performance, and build artifacts. Redirect to /benchmark if the user wants page speed.
- **Read-only by default.** Produce the report. Don't modify code unless the user explicitly asks for fixes.
